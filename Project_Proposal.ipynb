    "how sleep affects stress.\n",
    "* **Attribute description**:  \n",
    "    * snoring range\n",
    "    * respiration rate\n",

    "**anticipated challenges**: \n",
    "* all of the attributes are numerical, meaning there won't be much cleaning necessary, but we will have to discretize attributes for decision tree and naive bayes classification\n",
    "* there are 4 possible class labels, making it more difficult than binary classification\n",
    "* there are a lot of attributes so it will be difficult to discern which would be best to use for classification, or if we should use them all\n",
